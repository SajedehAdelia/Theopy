🌿 Theopy Gitflow Strategy

To demonstrate expert-level version control, Theopy follows a strict Gitflow workflow.

1. Branching Model

main: Mirror of production. Each merge here is a new release (v1.0.0, v1.1.0).

develop: Where all feature branches merge. This is the "nightly build" branch.

feature/*: Isolated branches for specific tasks.

2. Standard Workflow

Initialize: Ensure you are on develop.

Start Feature: make git-feature name=ai-integration

Commit: Use conventional commits (e.g., feat: add openai connection logic).

Merge: Push your feature and create a Pull Request (PR) to develop.

Release: When develop is stable, merge it into main with a tag.

3. Conventional Commits

feat: A new feature.

fix: A bug fix.

docs: Documentation changes.

test: Adding missing tests.

chore: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.
