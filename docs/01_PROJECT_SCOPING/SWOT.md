| **Strengths**     | - Seamless integration with Teepy enhances user productivity. <br> - Supports both voice and text communication, improving accessibility. <br> - Modular, Python-based architecture with Flask ensures maintainability and scalability. <br> - Local/offline processing options improve privacy. <br> - Real-time conversational AI improves usability and adoption.                     |
| **Weaknesses**    | - MVP may have limited NLU capabilities initially. <br> - Dependency on third-party STT/TTS engines (Whisper, gTTS) may introduce latency. <br> - Limited multi-language support at launch (mainly French). <br> - Requires constant API maintenance if Teepy backend changes.                                                                                                           |
| **Opportunities** | - Growing demand for voice-assisted productivity tools in professional environments. <br> - Potential to extend to English and other languages, expanding the market. <br> - Use AI analytics to improve user behaviour insights in Teepy. <br> - Position Kozea as an innovator in AI-driven enterprise tools. <br> - Future integration with other Kozea services or third-party apps. |
| **Threats**       | - Rapid evolution of AI assistants by competitors (Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT plugins). <br> - Privacy and GDPR compliance risks with voice data. <br> - Latency or misinterpretation of commands could frustrate users. <br> - Technical debt if NLU or STT/TTS integration is not optimised. <br> - Market resistance to new interaction paradigms (users preferring traditional UI).  |
