# Cost Estimation & Budget

## 1. Overview
This budget estimates the costs for the **MVP phase** of the Theopy project.
It is divided into **CAPEX** (Capital Expenditure - Development) and **OPEX** (Operating Expenditure - Running Costs).

## 2. CAPEX: Development Costs
*Based on the workload estimation of 38 Man-Days.*

| Item | Unit Cost (Est.) | Quantity | Total Cost |
|------|------------------|----------|------------|
| **Internal Development** (Junior/Mid Dev) | 300€ / day | 99.5 days | 29,850€ |
| **Project Management & Design** | 300€ / day | 10 days | 3,000€ |
| **Hardware** (Microphone/Headset for testing) | 150€ | 1 | 150€ |
| **Total CAPEX** | | | **33,000€** |

*Note: As an internal project (student project), these "costs" are often virtual (salary cost) rather than invoiced amounts.*

## 3. OPEX: Operating Costs (Monthly)

| Item | Description | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Server Hosting (VPS)** | OVH / DigitalOcean (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU for AI models) | 20€ | 240€ |
| **Domain Name** | .com or .io domain | ~1.50€ | 15€ |
| **API Costs (OpenAI)** | *Optional* (if not using local Whisper). Budget for testing. | 10€ | 120€ |
| **CI/CD & Repo** | GitHub (Free Tier) | 0€ | 0€ |
| **Monitoring** | Grafana/Prometheus (Self-hosted) | 0€ | 0€ |
| **Total OPEX** | | **31.50€** | **375€** |

## 4. Total Budget (Year 1)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Development (One-off)** | 33,000€ |
| **Operations (12 months)** | 375€ |
| **Contingency (10%)** | 3,337€ |
| **TOTAL** | **36,712€** |

## 5. ROI & Value Proposition
While the cost is ~15k€, the value lies in:
1. **Productivity:** Saving 5-10 mins per day per user. For 50 users @ 50€/hour:
   - 10 mins = ~8€/day/user saved.
   - 50 users = 400€/day saved.
   - **Break-even point:** ~37 working days.
2. **Innovation:** Positioning Kozea as a tech leader.
3. **Accessibility:** Opening Teepy to new user profiles.
